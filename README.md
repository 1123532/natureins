            <h2>Introduction to Dome Houses</h2>
            <p>The modern dome house is inspired by nature's efficient and harmonious designs. Made with recyclable materials, these homes minimize environmental impact and seamlessly blend into their surroundings. This project explores biomimicry principles in designing sustainable dome houses, aiming to inspire communities and stakeholders to adopt eco-friendly living.</p>

            <h2>Storytelling Through Biomimicry</h2>
            <p>Biomimicry storytelling helps bring design strategies to life by connecting with audiences on a deeper level. Using multimedia such as images, videos, and interactive content, we share the journey of dome house development, highlighting the inspiration from nature and its positive impact on the environment.</p>

            <h2>Learning from Local Development</h2>
            <p>In Indonesia, traditional architecture often emphasizes harmony with the environment. Inspired by these principles, our dome house designs incorporate local materials, cultural aesthetics, and modern sustainability practices. Dome houses, such as the geodesic structures found in Bali's eco-villages, showcase how this architectural style aligns with sustainable living and tropical climates. For example, the Bamboo Dome at Green School Bali demonstrates a balance between functionality, eco-friendliness, and beauty.</p>

                <h3>Student: Charlie (ID: 1123532)</h3>
                <p>My contribution focused on researching biomimicry concepts and identifying recyclable materials suitable for dome house construction. I also helped develop the multimedia storytelling strategy to engage stakeholders effectively. Additionally, I analyzed local Indonesian architectural styles, such as the Bamboo Dome at Green School Bali, for inspiration. The design ensures a balance between respecting the environment and integrating seamlessly into the natural landscape.</p>
